  <p>I grew up in Ottawa, Canada, in the village of Richmond. I did my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering at Queen's University. While at school, I was heavily involved with the Queen's Space Engineering Team

even serving as team captain in my Junior year. It was here that I gained my passion for robotics. Working in an interdisciplinary setting, and seeing all of the pieces of our Mars rover come together was incredibly rewarding.</p>
  <p>Wanting to continue down the robotics path, I pursued a Master's degree at the University of Toronto, working under Dr. Jonathan Kelly. My thesis title was <b>Unified Spatiotemporal Calibration of Egomotion Sensors and 2D Lidars in Arbitrary Environments</b>, and I received my degree in the fall of 2018.

  <p>I now work at Nvidia, where I have the opportunity to put my love of robotics into practice every day. We are building autonomy solutions for both consumer and industrial platforms. This necessarily means a modular design, that can be used with both mass-market sensor suites (as simple as a single camera on a car), as well as more complex, industrial-grade setups (multi-lidar + multi-radar + multi-camera systems).

  <p>In my free time, I love to run and hike. I completed my first half-marathon in 2019 and hope to do more. I also love to travel to new places. My favourite cities that I've visited are Tokyo, Japan, and Taipei, Taiwan, where I was lucky enough to spend a research term abroad at National Taiwan Normal University.</p>
